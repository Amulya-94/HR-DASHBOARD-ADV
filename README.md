## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   [Next.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18.x or higher is recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    If you have access to the project via a Git repository, clone it to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

To start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```

This will typically start the application on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) (the port is specified in `package.json`). Open this URL in your web browser to see the application.

### Running Genkit (for AI features)

If you are developing or using AI-powered features that rely on Genkit, you'll need to run the Genkit development server in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run genkit:dev
```

## üìä Data Source

The application currently uses **local mock data** for employee information, found in `src/lib/mock-indian-users.ts`. This data is designed to simulate a real-world dataset with Indian-sounding names and relevant HR details. This approach allows for full development and demonstration of features without requiring a backend database setup.

## üé® Theming

The application supports light and dark themes, configurable via a toggle in the header. Theme variables are defined in `src/app/globals.css` using HSL CSS variables for easy customization. The current theme is a monochrome blue.
